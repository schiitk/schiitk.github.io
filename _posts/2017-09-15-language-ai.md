This talk focuses on drawing parallels between the problems in artificially generating/understanding natural languages and the problems in general AI tasks. The hypothesis of the talk is that if we can 'solve' natural language, we also cover a lot of ground in solving major AI problems. The talk mainly focuses on the main problems in AI - sensing and recognition, understanding and exploration, communication and dialogue, and strategy and hypothesis testing and how similar problems are also encountered when thinking about natural language processing.
