Roth's theorem is a special case of Szemeredi's theorem, which loosely states that every dense enough subset of the integers must have a non-trivial arithmetic progression of length 3. In this talk, the speaker covered the historical background for this theorem and its many proofs, and discussed some proof ideas.

A detailed and more formal version of the proof demonstrated in the talk can be found [here](https://anuragsahay.github.io/mth392.pdf).

Unfortunately, no video recording is available for this talk.
