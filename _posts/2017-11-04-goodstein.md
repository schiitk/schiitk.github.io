More cool math! In the first talk by the newly entered Y17s, those in attendance were introduced to cardinality, ordinal numbers, all building up to a proof of Goodstein's theorem. The abstract of the talk is given below.

> Can infinity be used to prove finitary results? Indeed sometimes it becomes necessary to use it. We'll see how a set theoretic idea of infinite ordinals makes it possible to decipher the properties of a rather strange sequence of natural numbers.
